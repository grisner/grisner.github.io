# ThePanoply.se
The web page of The Panoply steelband

As we are a multitude of people, even though few are invested in this page so far I've decided to put the code here, to ease any collaboration.

# The carousel images
The image lists are in js/carousel.js. There is one list for images shown on screens with a width lower than 1000px and one for larger. The properties for the images are around 1:2, not exactly but that doesn't seem to be a problem. I suppose best practise is to take a large image, crop it to around 1:2, save as a webp with a size really smaller than 1MB but I'd like it closer to 500kB. Then scale it to a width of 1000px and make sure it's not more than 100kB in size.
